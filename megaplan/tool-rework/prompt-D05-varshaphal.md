# Plan 05 — Varshaphal (Annual Chart / Solar Return)

## Tradition
Vedic / Jyotish — Varshaphal (annual horoscope), cast for the exact moment the Sun
returns to its natal sidereal longitude each year, at the user's current location.

## Platforms
Web · iOS · Android

## Integration with megaplan
Depends on `frontend-rework` prompts C01 (theme) and C08 (ToolsScreen). New route: `Varshaphal`.
Depends on Tool 01 (Janma Kundli) for natal chart reference.

## What this tool does

Calculates and displays the user's Varshaphal — the Vedic annual chart for the
current year. Shows the annual Lagna (Varsha Lagna), Muntha position, planetary
placements for the year, and a 12-month divinatory forecast broken into quarters.

## Key UI rules (from #34 theme)

- Annual Lagna chip: `primaryContainer`
- Muntha chip: `secondaryContainer`
- Quarter cards: Q1/Q2 above fold; Q3/Q4 below; each uses `elevated` Card
- Remedy card: `secondaryContainer` background
