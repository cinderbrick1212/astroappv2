# Plan 15 — Graha Shanti (Remedies)

## Tradition
Vedic / Jyotish — Graha Shanti: the science of planetary propitiation through
gemstones (Ratna), mantras, yantras, fasting (Upvaas), charity (Daan), and
deity worship. Remedies are prescribed based on the natal chart's afflictions.

## Platforms
Web · iOS · Android

## Integration with #34
Depends on #34 prompts 01 (theme) and 08 (ToolsScreen). New route: `GrahaShanti`.
Depends on Tool 01 (Janma Kundli) for afflicted planet detection.
Remedy snippets appear in every tool screen (Tools 01–12); this screen is the
dedicated deep-dive where users can explore and understand all their remedies.

## What this tool does

Provides a complete, personalised Graha Shanti prescription based on the user's
Janma Kundli. Identifies which grahas need propitiation and why, then lists
the full remedy for each — gemstone details, beej mantra with pronunciation,
yantra, charity, fasting, deity worship, and auspicious colours.
